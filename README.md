# Exabyte Scientific Projects

This repository contains various scientific projects run by Exabyte.io. Create a virtual environment, and install the
project's requirements.txt file. I'll have all the packages needed to run these notebooks.

# Generating .py files

To generate the .py files (which exist only for the purposes of code review), run jupyter notebook with
`--config=config.py`. At that point, saving a notebook will also save a .py files containing the contents of the
notebook in a more human-readable form.
