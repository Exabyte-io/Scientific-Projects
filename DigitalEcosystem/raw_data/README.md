# Raw Data

This folder contains some raw data from various sources.

- `2d_materials_encyclopedia_dataset.pkl`is the 2D Materials Encyclopedia dataset available at http://www.2dmatpedia.org/. Some older notebooks in `exploratory` depend on it being named `2d_mat_dataset_raw.pkl`, so we've just made a symlink pointing to it.
- `perovskites.pkl` is a perovskites dataset (just typical ABO3 perovskites) that was acquired from NOMAD. For our purposes, we're interested in the DFT-optimized cell volumes that had been reported.
