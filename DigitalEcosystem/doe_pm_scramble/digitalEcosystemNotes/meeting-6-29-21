- TB: Overview of the DOE project
	- MS: So the definition of "FAIR" is not necessarily that it's immediately open. Some areas can't immediately be open (e.g. medical, industry). It should be in principle accessible, but not open in all asspects
	- TB: They didn't understand at first that our platform is open/collaborative
	- MS: Having full open access is not feasible, but similar to NOMAD, should have embargo periods

- Follow-up: MS to email regarding a couple of lawyer-like sentences

- SB - Question regarding physicality of the polarizability / num-p-valence descriptor in perovskite rung2 1-term model
	- MS: Materials genes, interpretable, tells you what you want to change; doesn't give you physical equation. Also possible that there is no equation.
		- Oftentimes, just a correlation, not a simple equation.
		- Screws that we can turn and have an effect
	- SB: Trying to envision bringint this in and making some predictions

- MS: Rank1 is not something usually used. Should go to rank 2 or rank 3 descriptors

- SB: Concern is bringing this in, and if any machine learning does good-enough
	- With that much data, a lot is given to chance.
	- TB: When we optimize a TPOT model, may lose transferrability. Keeping it simple, can move between different kinds of materials.

- Rahul: Compare 3D materials
- SB
	- Should look at differences within atoms for the BG
	- Should combine things
	- Try individual atoms in XenonPy

- MS: Need differences in electronegativities if we want to model the bandgap. Total average would not be related

- JD: Questions regarding VDW interactions
	- RB: Probably explained better because of the short range
	- SB: VDW does average, things like bandgap, other things might be a driving force we didn't have

- What's the right way to characterize structure
	- MS: All the 2D material systems have 
		- State of the art descriptors may be graph theory from Grossman. Turn unit cell into a graph as a fingerprint. 
			- Also has limitations
		- On GitHub by Xie, as well as Jeff Grossman (from Boston)


- MS: If structures are similar, could do multitask SISSO to learn it based on structure
	- Selects jointly the same type of descriptors, but different coeffficients for different structures
	- Multitask SISSO is another publication
